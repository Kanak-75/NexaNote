## Email Reminder (SMTP)

This app includes an Email Reminder feature that can send emails now or schedule them for a later date/time using SMTP (Gmail-ready).

### Backend (Flask)

Location: `backend/`

1) Setup and run:

```
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Configure email settings by creating `.env` file:

```
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Gmail credentials
```

For Gmail setup:
- Enable 2-Factor Authentication
- Generate an App Password (not your regular password)
- Use the App Password in `.env` as `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

3) Run the API:

```
python app.py
```

4) Endpoints:
- POST `/api/email/send` — `{ receiverEmail, subject?, body? }`
- POST `/api/email/schedule` — `{ receiverEmail, subject?, body?, runAtIso }`

Scheduling uses a background thread for demo purposes. For production, use a persistent scheduler (APScheduler/Celery).

### Frontend

`package.json` proxies to `http://localhost:5000`. Start the React app via `
npm start`, then open the sidebar item "Email Reminder" to use the form.

**User Experience**: Users only need to enter:
- Recipient email address
- Message content
- Optional: subject and schedule time

All SMTP configuration is handled server-side.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Professional UI components
- **date-fns**: Modern date manipulation library
- **UUID**: Unique identifier generation
- **Local Storage**: Data persistence
